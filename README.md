# Team Crime

Team Crime chose a project that would examine the occurances of crimes on college campuses in the US.  We will examine the number of crimes committed on college camuses by state and the strictness of the gun control laws in those states to determine in there is a possible correlation between gun control and violence on US campuses.  Specifically, we are looking to answer the question: Do states with stricter gun laws have less crime?  

We will be using campus violence data from https://ope.ed.gov/campussafety to give us information on crime activity on US college campuses and www.gunstocarry.com/gun-laws-state/, to give information on the strictness of gun control laws by state. We will create 3 visualizations to answer our question.   One will be a bubble chart to compare the total number of crimes in each state for each of the 3 years.  This will allow us to find any notable trends.  Another visualization will be a heat map showing the frequency of crime on college campus in the US.  The final visualization will be a base map with markers that, when selected, will show the gun law scale.  


## Purpose of the Analysis

Our primary purpose is to gather data using our sources determine if there is a correlation between college campus violence and gun control laws in US states.   After evaluating this information, we will be able to determine the story being told through the data and answer our inital question.
